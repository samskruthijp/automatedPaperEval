1----Composting is nature's way of recycling. Composting biodegrades organic waste. i.e. food waste, manure, leaves, grass trimmings, paper, wood, feathers, crop residue etc., and turns it into a valuable organic fertilizer. In agriculture, green manure is created by leaving uprooted or sown crop parts to wither on a field so that they serve as a mulch and soil amendment.-----2----The second law of motion gives us a method to measure the force acting on an object as a product of its mass and acceleration. while catching a fast moving cricket ball, a fielder in the ground gradually pulls his hands backwards with the moving ball. ... Thus, the rate of change of momentum of the ball will be large.-----3----Cross breeding is the process of breeding with the intention to create offspring that share the traits of both parent lineages or to produce an animal with hybrid vigour (the improved or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring).-----4----Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun, and the rotation of the Earth.-----5----Because while the body moves in a circular path its velocity at a point is along the tengent drawn from that point which gives rise to the centrifugal force and in the case of a satellite the centripital force is given by the gravity of earth and centrifugal force is given by its velocity.-----6----Because while the body moves in a circular path its velocity at a point is along the tengent drawn from that point which gives rise to the centrifugal force and in the case of a satellite the centripital force is given by the gravity of earth and centrifugal force is given by its velocity.-----7----This is because the atmospheric carbon dioxide is fixed through natural processes like photosynthesis by plants and chemo-bio synthesis by marine animals. The inorganic carbon compounds are converted to organic carbon compounds and later assimilated by living organisms. The current amount of atmospheric CO2 about 409 ppm is already higher than normal levels. Hence reduction of CO2 is encouraged to prevent globalwarming.-----8----Symbiosis is any type of a close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms, be it mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic. The organisms, each termed a symbiont, may be of the same or of different species.-----9----Parasitism is a relationship between two things in which one of them (the parasite) benefits from or lives off of the other, like fleas on your dog. Parasitism and its root, parasite, come from para-, meaning "beside" or "next to," and sito, meaning "bread or food."-----10----The term saturated solution is used in chemistry to define a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved in the solvent. It is understood that saturation of the solution has been achieved when any additional substance that is added results in a solid precipitate or is let off as a gas.Solubility is a chemical property referring to the ability for a given substance, the solute, to dissolve in a solvent. It is measured in terms of the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a solvent at equilibrium. Certain substances are soluble in all proportions with a given solvent, such as ethanol in water.
