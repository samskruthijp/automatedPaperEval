1----Explain any two methods of biological manuring.	Composting: A process where farm organic waste materials like crop and vegetable waste,livestock excreta and refuse, domestic and sewage waste are decomposed in pits to produce compost or vermicompost. Green manure: The fields are grown with crops like sun hemp, legumes, guar, etc., and then mulched into the soil prior to cropping season. These crops turn into green manure and increase soil fertility.-----5,,...2----Explain how the second law of motion influences a cricket fielder while catching a ball. 	When the ball approaches the fielder, he lowers his hands to catch the ball to decrease the acceleration of the ball and reduce the impact of the force on his hands and prevent from hurting. If the high velocity of the ball is suddenly dropped to zero in a short time, then rate of change of momentum of the ball will be large and will fall on the fielder’s hand with huge impact, according to Newton’s second law of motion.-----7,,...3----Explain cross-breeding of cattle.	Cattle breeding: The reproduction of cows, buffaloes through inbreeding or selective hybridization is called cattle breeding. Inbreeding involves reproduction through natural mating of animals. Selective breeding involves the selection of parent animals with desired traits and allowing them to breed so as to produce offspring with the bestdesired qualities of both parent animals.-----5,,....4----Give reason:Tides rising above the surface level of the sea.	Tides rise above the sea because of the combined gravitational force of sun and moon on the earth.-----3,,...5----Give reason:Satellite follows a circular path because of uniform circular motion and centripetal force.	Satellite follows a circular path because of uniform circular motion and centripetal force.-----3,,...
