1. Question Number Monsoon is considered as a
unifying
bond because: The seasonal alteration of the wind
systems and the associated weather conditions to
provide a rhythmic cycle
of seasons. These monsoon
winds binds the whole country by providing water
for
agricultural activities. A sense of
unity is imposed
by the monsoon. end of solution
2. Question Number Human resource is different from
other resources en
many
senses. Human resources
need education, training and healthcare to develop;
On the other hand, land and
physical capital
need
money
and physical inputs to develop. Land and
physical capital are useless without human resources.
end of solution
3. Question Number Yes, it is true that modern farming
methods require more inputs which are manufactured
in industry. HYV seeds, insecticides, pesticides
and chemical fertilizers needed for increasing
the
yield per hectare are all manufactured in the
industries, Farmers use farm machinery like tractors,
threshers and also combined harvesters which are
also manufactured in industries. Tube well
equipments and water
used for
pumps irrigation
are also manufactured in Endustries, end of solution
4. Question Number The spread of electricity has helped
the farmers of Palampur village. Electricity has transformed
the system of irrigation. Electricity is used to run
tube wells in the fields. The Persian wheels are
being replaced by tube wells. Electricity is used
also to run smaci Businesses. It is also used as a cheap and
pollution-free source of 
irrigation Electricity is also
used for domestic works like running fans and
Lighting tube lights. By 1970's, 200 hectares of
land were irrigated producing cultirable land
for maximum
output. end of solution.
5. Question Number The factors that led to the
enclosure movement in England
were
lncrese in prices of wool in the international
market and the Encreased demand for food grains in
England, Increase In Prices of wool in the 16th
century, the
price
of wool in the international
market went upto so the rich farmers wanted
to expand wool production to earn higher profits.
They were
eager to improve their sheep. breeds
and keen on
coutrolling large areas of cand in
compact blocks to allow improved breeding so they
started building hedges around their holdings
to separate their Property
from that of others. The
Increased Demand for Grain from the mid 18th
Century, the population of England expanded
rapidly;
more peple were living in the cities and
working
in the factories. As urban population grew
demand for food grains increased and food grain
prices rose. Because of the war with France,
trade was disrupted and import of grain from
Europe declined, increasing prices of food grains
iu England. This encouraged land owners to enclose.
land and enlarge areas
undervgrain cultivation leading
to the second enclosure movement. end of solution
6. Question Number To understand the mechanism of
the monsoons, the following facts are important
The differential heating and cooling of land and
water creates low pressure
on the landmass of India
while the seas around experience comparitively
high pressure. The shift of the position of Inter

Ocean tends to be low and vice-versa. This is known
as the Southern Oscillation. Some other events
such as ElNino, ENSO etc. are also connected to
the mechanism of monsoons. end of solution
7. Question Number The cold
weather season begins
from the November in northern India and
stays
till February. December and January are the most
coldest months in the northern part of India. The
temperature gradually
decreases during this period
from the south to the north. For example, in Chennai

Days are experienced warm while the

Himalayas 
experience snowfall, north east winds
blow over the country.
Wind blows from land 
to sea. Most parts of the country experiences
dry season, Tamil Nadu gets rain because of wind
movement from sea to land. A characteristic
feature of the cold weather season
over the northern plains is the
inflow of cyclonic
disturbances from the west and the north-
west. The low pressure systems originate oven
the Mediterranean Sea and Westean Asia and
move into India wath the westerly flow. They
cause the much needed winter rains over the
plains and snowfall in the mountains, The total
rainfall is accounted to around 70cm. The peninsular
region doesnot have a welldefined cold season.
There is hardly any
noticeable
change
in the
temperature pătters during winter due to the
moderating
influence of the sea, end of solution
8. Question Number The President appoints the Prime

9. Question Number farm workers at Palampur village
get lower wages than the minimum wages
fixed by
the government. The minimum wages
for a fam
labourer is fixed at Rs.60 per day. But fanm
labourers
get only Rs.35-40. This happens becaus
there is heavy competition for work among the
farm labourer in rampur as workerare more and
Work is less, s0 people agree to work in lower
wages,
Due to less Demand and more supply there is
great competition for work among
the farm
labourers. So they
themselves
agree
to work at
much tower wages
than the fixed wages by the
government. Also most of the labourers in
Palampun
are unskilled. The
large farmers knowing the actual
condition, exploit this condition of excess supply
the and force labourers to work for lower wages.
The use of modern agricultural implements
like
tractors, threshers and harvesters 'also reduce
the amount of agriculture labour required.
This further intensifies the competitton among
the labourers Cooking for jobs. end of solution
10. Question Number Multiple cropping and use of modern
farming methods are two different ways
increasing production ou the same plece of land.
e.g.,(i) Multiple cropping when more than one
crop is grown on a
piece of land during the year
it is known as multiple cropping.(a) It is the most
common
way
to increase production on a given piece
of land. (b) All farmers in
Palampur grow atleast
two maincrops; many are
growing potato as the
third crop in the
Past 15-20 years. To (11) Use
Modean farming
methods modern farming
methods also
help to increase the yield per
hectare, (a) farmers of
Punjab, Haryana and
Western Uttar Pradesh were the first to try
modern farming methods in India.lb) The farmers
in regions set up tube wells for irrigation
and made use of the HYV seeds, chemical fertilizers
and pesticides in farming. (c)Some also used farm
machinery like tractors and threshers, which
made plugging and harvesting faster.
They
were rewarded with high yields of wheat',
increasing
from 1300kg per hectare to 3200 kg
per hectare with HYV seeds.
